# Link for acessing cleo the career guidance chatbot

There are so many ways to find out ur ideal career. But one thing they have in common is a long boring quiz format.

 

Data on all the careers are given there but our chatbot gives data on a specific field

 

But cleo is different. It is a chatbot and adjusts itself according to each person. It is personalised.  It's like talking to a friend.

 

Instead of a regular quiz you can ask doubts  and questions to cleo.

 

It's an innovative, mind boggling approach towards Career guidance.

 

That is the significance of cleo, our brilliant idea.

 

One thing we can say,..today every one has to go somewhere and have an appointment, but 

 

cleo clears all doubts they have and counsellor's time isn't wasted on usual queries,..an appointment with a counsellor is booked only if necessary because cleo answers al

 

Also instead of a huge list having the list of careers and their info,..our chatbot will provide just the info that the user wants
